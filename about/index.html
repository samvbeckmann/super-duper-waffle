      <h2>What?</h2>
      <p>
        <em>What's My Vote Worth?</em> is a data visualization project created
        by three students at the University of Tulsa for the local ACM Fall
        Code-Jam, where it won first place. The data reflects the 2016 US
        election between Hillary Clinton (D) and Donald Trump (R).
      </p>
      <h2>Why?</h2>
      <p>
        We all think it's strange in America, as a result of gerrymandering
        and the electoral college, that the votes of some Americans are
        worth much more to the outcome of the election than others.
        We wanted to quanify this difference and make it clear in an
        interactive visualization.
      </p>
      <h2>How?</h2>
      <p>
        The visualization was created using
        <a href="http://d3js.org">D3</a>.
        The complete methodology used to rank vote worth in each state can
        be found on the
        <a href="/methodology">methodology page</a>.
