		<h3>Jon Bolin</h3>
			<p>Intelligent. Timid. Taller than average. I have enormous blue eyes that
reveal the depths of oceans.</p>
<p><br/>
My name is Jon.
</p>
<p><br/>
I like soccer, programming, and math. And I'm really smart. Really,
as in real. Not fake. My friends call me big, tall, strong, flexible Jon.
I like dogs and walks in the rain. I'm always wearing one of three
hoodies because I'm terrified of others' seeing my arms. I like to
wear jeans and I never wear shorts.
</p>
<p><br/>
I'll be super kind to you, I promise, because I'm super kind to everyone
because I'm too awkward to be conflictual at all. I have humorous reactions
because I don't know how not to laugh at everything!
</p>
<p><br/>
Girls tell me that I'm a great kisser. I've heard that from a lot of girls
because I've never been in a relationship beforeâ€”but I've realized that
I want more out of my romantic life. And that's why I'm here. I'd like
to settle down and find a family, if possible.
</p>
<p><br/>
If you'd like to meet an attractive young man capable of literally
sweeping you off of your feet and solving your life's most difficult
problems who kisses great, then I'm your man ;)</p>
