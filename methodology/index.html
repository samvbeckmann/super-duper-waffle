          <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>Our calculation of the importance of a vote is simply the product
                of the two following factors:
            </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The vote weight: The number of electoral votes per voter</li>
                    <li>The ambiguity factor:
                        The probability of the state swinging in the election</li>
                </ol>
            <p>
                This score is then provided as ordinal data, as its actual
                numeric value has no intrinsic meaning.
            </p>

          <h4>Calculating Vote Weight</h4>
            <p>The vote weight calculation is simple: We divide the number of
                electoral votes in the state by the number of active voters in the
                state.
            </p>

            <p>We calculate the number of active voters in the state by using a
                simple least-squares linear regression model based off of data
                from the past 5 presidential elections gathered from the <a
                href="http://www.census.gov/topics/public-sector/voting.html">US
                Census Bureau</a>. Intuitively, the vote weight refers to a
                general likelihood for your vote to swing the election based
                solely off of the number of voters in your state.</p>

          <h4>Calculating the Ambiguity Factor</h4>
            <p>The ambiguity factor represents the likelihood that a vote will
                swing in an election. The formula for this calculation is
                based off of polling data for each state. Where trump refers to
                the proportion of respondents voting for Donald Trump and
                clinton refers to the proportion of respondents voting for
                Hillary Clinton. Finally, undecided refers to the proportion
                of respondents who had not yet decided for which candidate
                to cast their votes.
            </p>
            <pre><code>1 - (|trump - clinton| - undecided)</code></pre>
            <p>These results are then normalized into the range [0.01, 0.99] (as
                an admission that complete certainty either way is impossible).
            </p>
            <p>The polling data used was taken from Huffington Post's
                <a href="http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster#2016-general-election">
                Pollster data</a> on October 15, 2016.
