# What's My Vote Worth?

## What?
_What's My Vote Worth?_ is a data visualization project created by three students at the University of Tulsa for the local ACM Fall Code-Jam, where it won first place. The data reflects the 2016 US election between Hillary Clinton (D) and Donald Trump (R).

## Why?
We all think it's strange in America, as a result of gerrymandering and the electoral college, that the votes of some Americans are worth much more to the outcome of the election than others. We wanted to quanify this difference and make it clear in an interactive visualization.

## How?
The visualization was created using [D3](d3js.org). The complete methodology used to rank vote worth in each state can be found on the [methodology page](samvbeckmann.com/vote-weight/methodology).
